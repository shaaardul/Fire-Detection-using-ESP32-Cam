# Fire-Detection-using-ESP32-Cam
Developed a fire detection system using an ESP32 Cam, FTDI module, and a custom YoloV8 machine learning model. The ESP32 Cam captures video from a webcam, and the ML model analyzes the footage to detect fire. When a fire is identified, the system activates a buzzer alarm.
